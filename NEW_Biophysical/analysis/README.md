### General information

Library for analysing the effect of synaptic clustering on neuronal selectivity

for more details, see our paper on bioRxive:

This code reproduces the main figures of the paper: the sensitivity of CA1 neurons to the cluster size. The high level data generated by analysing the row voltage response of the biophysical model are provided witht the library in the folder "datasets". 

For the full analysis, the biophysical model has to be simulated first with the right parameterset and its response has to be saved in the right directory. 

### Requirements

To run the code, you need R (3.4) installed with a few extra packages. 

### Details

The files roughly correspond to panels from the paper.  

### Expected output

The corresponding figures of the paper.
